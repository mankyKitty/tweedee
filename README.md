A learning project designed to teach me how to implement a gloriously and laughably simple 3D game engine using Haskell.

Ideally I will be proceeding using QuickCheck properties for the various components so I can satisfy my generally poor maths brain that I am close to the mark.

The end goal being some sort of exploratory project that hopefull I can use to springboard into finer and more awesome things.

Wish me luck because not even serious game devs think building your own 2D engine is a wise thing.
